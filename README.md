# Simple Neural Network Implementation in Matlab
Slight improvement over the work of Carl LÃ¶ndahl (2020). A very simple and intuitive neural network implementation (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22010-a-very-simple-and-intuitive-neural-network-implementation), MATLAB Central File Exchange. Retrieved July 17, 2020.

This code runs about 30% faster, by doing some vectorization, simplifications and that's it. Plase go to the original source for a much better explanation of what the code does.
